# Disable default features and only enable tcp transport for zenoh. This reduces
# build time but more importantly allows us to limit the number of threads that
# the zenoh session can spin via the session config as well as the ASYNC_STD_THREAD_COUNT
# environment variable. Without this limit, applications with multiple zenoh sessions can
# encounter system resource errors when trying to create new threads.
# Once zenoh migrates to relying on tokio for its async runtime,
# see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/pull/566, we can consider
# removing these flags since with tokio, zenoh can better manage the threads it spins
# with the help of thread pools.
# Note: We separate the two args needed for cargo with "$<SEMICOLON>" and not ";" as the
# latter is a list separater in cmake and hence the string will be split into two
# when expanded.
